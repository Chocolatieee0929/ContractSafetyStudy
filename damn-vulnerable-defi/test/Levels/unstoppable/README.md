# Challenge #1 - Unstoppable
There's a lending pool with a million DVT tokens in balance, offering flash loans for free.

If only there was a way to attack and stop the pool from offering flash loans ...

You start with 100 DVT tokens in balance.
Your goal is to drain all of the tokens from the pool.
